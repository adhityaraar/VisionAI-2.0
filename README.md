# VisionAI
VisionAI is a project that uses object detection to detect personal protective equipment (PPE) in a given image. The project is built using the YOLOv8 model and is deployed on a Jetson Nano device. The project is built using Python and Flask.

## There are 3 steps to run the VisionAI project:

### Jetson Nano Preparation 
1. Prepare your Jetson Nano, camera device, and support device 

2. Installation:
   - jetpack==4.6.1
   - Ubuntu==18.04
   - cuda==10.2
   - Python==3.8.18

### Setup Python Virtual Environment 
To run the code in your local, it is best to setup a virtual environment first. 

1. Create new environment using conda in local:
   - `conda create --name VisionAI --file requirements.txt`
   - `conda activate VisionAI`

2. if using Jetson nano, need to install manually from libraries by using bash .sh
   - `sudo bash installPython.sh sh`
   - `sudo bash enlargeMemorySwap.sh sh`
   - `sudo bash pre_installOpencv.sh sh`
   - `sudo bash installOpencvandtorch.sh sh`

### Running object detection 
1. Run the VisionAI object detection. Here, we are using flask bash python app.py

2. Access it on other device (local network)
   - make sure the device have one internet connection, check the local ip address:
     - `ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -Fv 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'`
   - The example result will be, `url=192.xx.xx.xx`
   - Run in your browser device: `http://:5000/`
